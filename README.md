## Setup & How to Run

This project was developed in Google Colab.

The notebook (`notebook.ipynb`) is ready to run, but it assumes the following file structure is present in the Colab session's root `/content/` directory:

```
/content/
├── csv_files/
│   ├── historical_data.csv
│   └── fear_greed_index.csv
├── outputs/
├── ds_report.pdf
└── notebook.ipynb
```

Before running, simply create the `csv_files` and `outputs` folders in your Colab session and upload the two data CSVs into the `csv_files` folder. The notebook will then run without any path modifications.
